# Atari

This directory contains problems from the "Atari" section of the OpenAI Gym [environments](https://gym.openai.com/envs/#atari).

## How to run?

For now, just use `python script.py -episodic` within this directory to run a training session on the `PongDeterministic-v4` environment with its default parameters.
