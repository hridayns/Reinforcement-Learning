- Awarded *Best Paper* for research thesis titled **Damped Sinusoidal Exploration Decay Schedule to improve Deep Q-Networks-based agent performance**.
- As sole student author, proposed a novel damped sinusoidal equation to perform exploration decay instead of linear epsilon decay by a constant factor to optimize DQN-based reinforcement learning agents in sparse-reward environments. Utilized the Google Colab virtual machine powered by a NVIDIA Tesla K80 GPU and 13 GB RAM to process terabytes of data over 3500 episodes in over 16 training cycles each lasting up to 48 hrs.
- Presented at the 4th International Conference on **Artificial Intelligence and Evolutionary Computations in Engineering Systems 2019** organized in association with Springer, IEEE and IET from 11th to 13th April, chaired by Dr. Ramazan Bayindir.
- Accepted for publication in Springer *Advances in Intelligent Systems and Computing* (AISC) series.
